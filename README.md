This C++ program simulates the process of DNA sequence reconstruction by generating a random sequence, splitting it into overlapping subsequences (oligonucleotides), and introducing both negative and positive errors.
It creates a graph based on sequence overlaps to guide reconstruction and uses algorithms like Dijkstra's to analyze connections between subsequences. 
Finally, it attempts to reconstruct the original sequence and compares the result using Levenshtein distance and coverage percentage metrics.
